This unit needs to apply a BIOS update.

☢️Galileo devices can be BRICKED by BIOS updates if you interrupt them.  The screen often fails to turn on, or displays garbage, during the update.

PLEASE READ CAREFULLY:
- When you click accept, the unit will reboot.
- 🙅 DO NOT TOUCH IT for _ten entire minutes_. It doesn't matter how stuck, off, or broken it looks.

-> If the unit is still stuck AFTER TEN MINUTES, force cycle it with the power button.  Then, _wait ten minutes_ again to be safe!  It may now be finishing its update.

-> If the unit appears bricked, ping #steampal-sw - you'll likely need to stop by 13S to get it revived.

🚨 WARNING SCROLL UP AND READ THE ABOVE BEFORE CONTINUING 🚨
