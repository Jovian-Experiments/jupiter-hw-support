BIOS Update Incoming!

⚠️ MESSING WITH THIS CAN BRICK YOUR DEVICE. Seriously. No joke.

Quick Rundown (READ IT!):

1. Click accept, and your device will reboot.
2. 🚫 DON'T TOUCH for 10 WHOLE MINUTES. Screen might be off, frozen or look dead. We know, just chill.

-> After 10 mins, still stuck? Force cycle with power button. WAIT ANOTHER 10 MINUTES.

-> Bricked? Congrats, we saw that coming. Ping #steampal-sw and visit 13S for a fix.

🦄 WARNING: Ignoring this is a one-way ticket to Bricksville. Enjoy the ride! 🎢
