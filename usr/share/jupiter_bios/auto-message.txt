WARNING BIG FAT WARNING READ READ READ

This unit needs a BIOS update.  BIOS updates are fixing critical memory and other issues right now, don't skip this.

But, Galileo devices can be BRICKED by BIOS updates if you interrupt them.

It gets worse!  Right now, the screen often fails to turn on, or displays garbage, during BIOS updates.

SO READ CAREFULLY:
- Make sure the unit is plugged in and/or has plenty of battery
- When you click accept, the unit will reboot
- Make note of the time
- DO NOT TOUCH IT for _ten entire minutes_
- !! It doesn't matter how stuck, off, broken or otherwise, the unit looks.  As long as it is not actively on fire, leave it be.
- Do not touch it until ten minutes have passed

-> If the unit is still stuck AFTER TEN MINUTES:
   - Probably the screen failed to turn on after the update. This also happens.
   - Force cycle it with the power button.
   - After it beeps and begins booting, WAIT FOR ANOTHER TEN MINUTES before deciding it did not boot!  It may now be finishing its update.

-> If the unit appears bricked and you can no longer get it to boot, ping #steampal-sw - you'll likely need to stop by 13S to get it revived.

The update should be reliable as long as your finger stays the heck away from the power button.

WARNING READ THE ABOVE BEFORE CONTINUING
